LINUX is an operating system or a kernel distributed under an open-source license. 
Its functionality list is quite like UNIX.
The kernel is a program at the heart of the Linux operating system that takes care of fundamental stuff, like letting hardware communicate with software.
Linux is an operating system or a kernel which germinated as an idea in the mind of young and bright Linus Torvalds when he was a computer science student
He used to work on the UNIX OS (proprietary software) and thought that it needed improvements
.Being open-source, anyone with programming knowledge can modify it.
The Linux operating systems now offer millions of programs/applications to choose from, most of them free!Once you have Linux installed you no longer need an antivirus! Linux is a highly secure system.
 More so, there is a global development community constantly looking at ways to enhance its security. With each upgrade, the OS becomes more secure and robust.
